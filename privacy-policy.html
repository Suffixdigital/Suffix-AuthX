<h2>Privacy Policy for Suffix AuthX</h2>

<p>Suffix AuthX is a developer tool used to test Firebase Authentication. 
The app only handles basic login information provided by Firebase such as user name, email, and profile picture. 
We do not store, sell, share, or collect any user data on our servers. 
All authentication operations are processed directly by Google Firebase.</p>

<h3>Data Handling:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Information is only displayed inside the app after login.</li>
  <li>No data is transferred to any external server other than Firebase.</li>
  <li>No analytics, ads, or tracking services are used.</li>
  <li>User can logout anytime and no data is retained.</li>
</ul>
